Please read this notice before using SpinningMomo.  
By downloading, installing, or using the software, you acknowledge and accept this notice.

## 1. Project Nature

- SpinningMomo is an open-source third-party desktop tool, with source code licensed under MIT.
- It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or guaranteed by Infinity Nikki or its developers/publishers.

## 2. Data Scope (Primarily Local)

The software primarily processes data on your local device, including:
- Configuration data: for example target window title, game directory, output directory, feature toggles, and UI preferences (for example `settings.json`).
- Runtime data: logs and crash files (for example files under `logs/`).
- Feature data: local index and metadata (for example `database.db` used by gallery-related features).

By default, the project has no account system, no ad SDK, and does not actively upload your local file contents.

## 3. Network Behavior

- When you trigger update-related actions (for example check/download updates), the app connects to update sources.
- Those providers may log standard access metadata (for example IP, timestamp, and User-Agent).

## 4. Data Sharing and User Submissions

- By default, local data is not actively uploaded to a developer-controlled server.
- If you voluntarily submit issues, logs, crash dumps, or screenshots on public platforms, you are responsible for the content you disclose there.

## 5. Risk and Disclaimer

- The software is provided "as is", without warranty of uninterrupted operation, universal compatibility, or error-free behavior.
- You are responsible for evaluating and accepting usage risks, including but not limited to performance issues, compatibility problems, data loss, crashes, or other unexpected outcomes.
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, maintainers are not liable for indirect, incidental, or special damages arising from use or inability to use the software.

## 6. Usage Boundary

You may use this software only for lawful and compliant purposes, and must not use it for illegal, destructive, or malicious activities.

## 7. Changes and Support

- This notice may be updated as the project evolves. New versions are published in the repository/docs site.
- Continued use means you accept the updated notice.
- No one-to-one support or response-time commitment is provided. If Issues are enabled, you may submit feedback there.
